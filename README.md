# C Raycaster Game

A small game made with C and Raylib that uses a raycaster for graphics. Started as a project to learn how software renderers of old games worked, would like to use this knowledge to expand from a simple tile based map like this to something more complicated, such as the Doom renderer.

## Installation
To install it, you have to build it, binaries will not be provided until this game is in a format where there is actual gameplay! Please put Raylib headers in an `include/` directiory and put the library in a `lib/` directory, then if you run the makefile it should run the game, with the binary being found in the newly created bin folder.
